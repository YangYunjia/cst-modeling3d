CST method
---------------------------

Surface and curve modeling via class shape function transformation (CST) method.

The CST method combines class functions and shape functions to describe an arbitrary geometry 
and can guarantee airfoil smoothness with comparatively fewer design variables. 
Usually, a sixth-order Bernstein polynomial is used as the shape function; i.e., seven CST parameters are used to describe upper and lower surfaces.

The curves, e.g., foil's upper and lower surfaces, are constructed via CST method. The multi-section surface is interpolated from several control sections.
